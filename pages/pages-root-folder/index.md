### Who we are 
We are Alon Green Recycling, a social enterprise in Lagos working to divert plastic waste from landfills and water bodies through sensitization and initiation of efficient collection schemes. Our goal is to substitute the market’s need for virgin plastic materials by providing ethically recovered used plastics.
We are driven by the fact that Lagos can become a sustainable city by leveraging circular economy opportunities and needs to become a model city to other urban cities in Nigeria and across Africa.

### The PET waste problem
Nigeria's population is one of the world's fastest growing and Lagos is one of the top 10 mega city migration destinations. Nigeria generates 32 million tons of waste per year of which 2.5 million tons is plastic waste; Lagos alone produces ~ 10,000 metric tons of plastic waste daily (1.3 million tons annually). 

Plastic pollution constitutes a major environmental problem in Lagos and Nigeria as:
* It contributes to climate change and the emission of greenhouse gases 
* It is detrimental to marine life as most of the world’s plastics end in the oceans leading to loss of marine life
* Light showers of rain result in excessive flooding because the landfills and drainage systems are clogged with plastics

### Our solution

We sensitize the community on the importance of reducing single plastic use and encouraging recovery and recycling of plastics to reduce carbon footprints and as a means of job creation. We work mostly with businesses, residential estates and micro-entrepreneurs:

*Corporates:* We work with businesses who generate a lot of plastic waste to sort their recyclables on site to ensure efficiency and pick-up from their sites. We also provide these businesses with data on the volumes of plastics they have recycled on a quarterly basis for their annual reports and sustainability impact monitoring.

*Residences:* We work with estates to set up plastic collection centres on their premises to enable efficient sorting and pick up their recyclables. We have also developed buy-back schemes for household waste and letting households choose the most efficient way they want to be compensated (point system, instant cash, airtime top-ups etc.).

*Micro-entrepreneurs:* We work with women in the community that are collectors and have difficulty selling the collected PET. We have been able to create an avenue for them to sell the collected PET and make extra income.
