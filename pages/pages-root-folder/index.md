ALON GREEN RECYCLING is a social enterprise working to eliminate waste by sensitization and initiation of buy-back schemes for different waste streams. Starting with Lagos, we want to create sustainable cities through efficient collection systems by helping households turn waste to wealth and helping businesses maximise their waste streams.

### The problem

Sub-Saharan Africa is Projected to become the dominant region globally in terms of total waste generation. Lagos has a population of about 15million inhabitants which continues to grow rapidly, without formal waste collection systems able to cater for the population.

Plastics pollute nature, endanger wildlife, clog gutters and drainage which leads to floods during rainfalls with discarded plastic being at the forefront of  major environmental problems recycling is more important than ever.

About 1 million tons of plastics are used in Lagos annually with 4% recycled. Plastic wastes are generated in thousands and indiscriminately disposed of, defeating the goal of sustainable urban development, building climate smart cities  and reducing the carbon footprint.

### Our solution
* We sensitise the community and harmonise all existing collection systems by creating buy-back schemes for household waste and letting households choose the most efficient way they want to be compensated (point system, instant cash, airtime top-ups etc.).
* We work directly with manufacturers across board to collect their plastic waste and ensure efficiency in their waste stream by reprocessing their waste.
* Reducing carbon footprint.
* Providing jobs.
* Providing income and making a profit.
